<p>
I am an astrophysicist and postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://www.issibern.ch">International Space Science Insitute (ISSI)</a> in Bern, Switzerland.<br>

I work on the field of Exoplanets. In particular, I develop and run numerical models to study how planets form.

I am originally from Uruguay. There I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics, option Astronomy.
<br> In 2012 I moved to Switzerland to do my PhD at the University of Bern. I live in Switzerland since then.
<br> Before working at ISSI, I was a postdoc at the University of Zurich.
