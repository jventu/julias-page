<p>
I am an astrophysicist and SNSF Ambizione Fellow at the Department of Astronomy of the University of Geneva, Switzerland.<br>

I work on the field of Exoplanets. In particular, I develop and run numerical models to study how planets form.

I am originally from Uruguay. There I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics, option Astronomy, at the Universidad de la Republica.
<br> In 2012 I moved to Switzerland to do my PhD at the University of Bern. I live in Switzerland since then.
<br> Before working at the Geneva Observatory, I was a postdoctoral fellow at ISSI, and a postdoc at the University of Zurich.
