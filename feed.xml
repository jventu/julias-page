The continuity in the fraction of volatiles in these planets suggests a formation scenario involving planetesimal or hybrid pebble-planetesimal accretion. Moreover, we find that the transition between super-Earths and sub-Neptunes appears to happen at different masses (and radii) depending on the spectral type of the star. The maximum mass of super-Earths seems to be close to 10 M⊕ for all spectral types, but the minimum mass of sub-Neptunes increases with the star’s mass, and is around 1.9 M⊕, 3.4 M⊕, and 4.3 M⊕, for M-dwarfs, K-dwarfs, and FG-dwarfs, respectively. The precise value of this minimum mass may be affected by observational bias, but the trend appears to be reliable.

While sub-Neptunes are less common around M-dwarfs, smaller ones (1.8 Re &lt; Rp &lt; 2.8 R⊕) exhibit lower density than their equivalents around FGK-dwarfs. Nonetheless, the sample of well-characterized small exoplanets remains limited, and each new discovery has the potential to reshape our understanding and interpretations of this population in the context of internal structure, composition, formation, and evolution models.

Occultations are windows of opportunity to indirectly peek into the dayside atmosphere of exoplanets. High-precision transit events provide information on the spin-orbit alignment of exoplanets around fast-rotating hosts.
Aims: We aim to precisely measure the planetary radius and geometric albedo of the ultra-hot Jupiter (UHJ) KELT-20 b along with the spin-orbit alignment of the system.
Methods: We obtained optical high-precision transits and occultations of KELT-20 b using CHEOPS observations in conjunction with simultaneous TESS observations. We interpreted the occultation measurements together with archival infrared observations to measure the planetary geometric albedo and dayside temperatures. We further used the host star’s gravity-darkened nature to measure the system’s obliquity.
Results: We present a time-averaged precise occultation depth of 82 ± 6 ppm measured with seven CHEOPS visits and 131−7+8 from the analysis of all available TESS photometry. Using these measurements, we precisely constrain the geometric albedo of KELT-20 b to 0.26 ± 0.04 and the brightness temperature of the dayside hemisphere to 2566−80+77 K. Assuming Lambertian scattering law, we constrain the Bond albedo to 0.36−0.05+0.04 along with a minimal heat transfer to the night side (ϵ = 0.14−0.10+0.13). Furthermore, using five transit observations we provide stricter constraints of 3 9 ± 1 1 deg on the sky-projected obliquity of the system.
Conclusions: The aligned orbit of KELT-20 b is in contrast to previous CHEOPS studies that have found strongly inclined orbits for planets orbiting other A-type stars. The comparably high planetary geometric albedo of KELT-20 b corroborates a known trend of strongly irradiated planets being more reflective. Finally, we tentatively detect signs of temporal variability in the occultation depths, which might indicate variable cloud cover advecting onto the planetary day side.</p>

TOI-732 is an M dwarf hosting two transiting planets that are located on the two opposite sides of the radius valley. Inferring a reliable demographics for this type of systems is key to understanding their formation and evolution mechanisms.</p>

<p>Aims. By doubling the number of available space-based observations and increasing the number of radial velocity (RV) measurements, we aim at refining the parameters of TOI-732 b and c. We also use the results to study the slope of the radius valley and the density valley for a well-characterised sample of M-dwarf exoplanets.</p>

<p>Methods. We performed a global Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis by jointly modelling ground-based light curves and CHEOPS and TESS observations, along with RV time series both taken from the literature and obtained with the MAROON-X spectrograph. The slopes of the M-dwarf valleys were quantified via a support vector machine (SVM) procedure.</p>

<p>Results. TOI-732b is an ultrashort-period planet (P = 0.76837931-0.00000042+0.0000039 days) with a radius Rb = 1.325-0.058+0.057R⊕, a mass Mb = 2.46 ± 0.19 M⊕, and thus a mean density ρb = 5.8-0.8+1.0 g cm-3, while the outer planet at P = 12.252284 ± 0.000013 days has Rc = 2.39-0.11+0.10R⊕, Mc = 8.04-0.48+0.50M⊕, and thus ρc = 3.24-0.43+0.55 g cm-3. Even with respect to the most recently reported values, this work yields uncertainties on the transit depths and on the RV semi-amplitudes that are smaller up to a factor of ~1.6 and ~2.4 for TOI-732 b and c, respectively. Our calculations for the interior structure and the location of the planets in the mass-radius diagram lead us to classify TOI-732 b as a super-Earth and TOI-732 c as a mini-Neptune. Following the SVM approach, we quantified d log Rp,valley / d logP = -0.065-0.013+0.024, which is flatter than for Sun-like stars. In line with former analyses, we note that the radius valley for M-dwarf planets is more densely populated, and we further quantify the slope of the density valley as d log ρ^valley / d log P = -0.02-0.04+0.12.</p>

<p>Conclusions. Compared to FGK stars, the weaker dependence of the position of the radius valley on the orbital period might indicate that the formation shapes the radius valley around M dwarfs more strongly than the evolution mechanisms.</p>

The number of exoplanets with precise mass and radius measurements is constantly increasing thanks to novel ground- and space-based facilities such as HARPS, ESPRESSO, CHEOPS, and TESS. The accuracy and robustness of the planetary characterization largely depends on the quality of the data, but also requires a planetary structure model, capable of accurately modeling the interior and atmospheres of exoplanets over a large range of boundary conditions.</p>

<p>Aims. Our goal is to provide an improved characterization model for planets with masses between 0.5 and 30 Earth masses, equilibrium temperatures below $&lt;2000$ K, and a wide range of planetary compositions and physical phases.</p>

<p>Methods. In this work, we present the Bayesian Interior Characterization of ExoPlanetS (BICEPS) model, which combines an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method with a state-of-the-art planetary structure model. BICEPS incorporates many recently developed equations of state suited for large ranges of pressures and temperatures, a description for solid and molten planetary cores and mantles, a gaseous envelope composed of hydrogen, helium, and water (with compositional gradients), and a non-gray atmospheric model.</p>

<p>Results. We find that the usage of updated equations of state has a significant impact on the interior structure prediction. The impact varies, depending on the planetary composition. For dense rocky planets, BICEPS predicts radii a few percent different to prior internal structure models. For volatile rich planets, we find differences of 10% or even larger. When applying BICEPS to a particular exoplanet, TOI-130 b, we inferred a 25% larger water mass fraction and a 15% smaller core than previous models.</p>

<p>Conclusions. The presented exoplanet characterization model is a robust method applicable over a large range of planetary masses, compositions, and thermal boundary conditions. We show the importance of implementing state-of-the-art equations of state for the encountered thermodynamic conditions of exoplanets. Hence, using BICEPS improves the predictive strength of the characterization process compared to previous methods.</p>

The TOI-178 system consists of a nearby late K-dwarf transited by six planets in the super-Earth to mini-Neptune regime, with radii
ranging from ∼1.1 to 2.9 R⊕ and orbital periods between 1.9 and 20.7 days. All planets but the innermost one form a chain of Laplace resonances.
Mass estimates derived from a preliminary radial velocity (RV) dataset suggest that the planetary densities do not decrease in a monotonic way
with the orbital distance to the star, contrary to what one would expect based on simple formation and evolution models.
Aims. To improve the characterisation of this key system and prepare for future studies (in particular with JWST), we perform a detailed photo-
metric study based on 40 new CHEOPS visits, one new TESS sector, as well as previously published CHEOPS, TESS, and NGTS data.
Methods. First we update the parameters of the host star using the new parallax from Gaia EDR3. We then perform a global analysis of the 100
transits contained in our data to refine the physical and orbital parameters of the six planets and study their transit timing variations (TTVs). We
also use our extensive dataset to place constraints on the radii and orbital periods of potential additional transiting planets in the system.
Results. Our analysis significantly refines the transit parameters of the six planets, most notably their radii, for which we now obtain relative
precisions ≲3%, with the exception of the smallest planet b for which the precision is 5.1%. Combined with the RV mass estimates, the measured
TTVs allow us to constrain the eccentricities of planets c to g, which are found to be all below 0.02, as expected from stability requirements. Taken
alone, the TTVs also suggest a higher mass for planet d than the one estimated from the RVs, which had been found to yield a surprisingly low
density for this planet. However, the masses derived from the current TTV dataset are very prior-dependent and further observations, over a longer temporal baseline, are needed to deepen our understanding of this iconic planetary system.</p>
