Mini-Neptunes seem to be common planets. In this work we investigate the possible formation histories
and predicted occurrence rates of mini-Neptunes, assuming that the planets form beyond the iceline.
We consider pebble and planetesimal accretion accounting for envelope enrichment and two different
opacity conditions. We find that the formation of mini-Neptunes is a relatively frequent output when
envelope enrichment by volatiles is included, and that there is a “sweet spot” for mini-Neptune
formation with a relatively low solid accretion rate of $$\sim 10^{-6}$$ $$M_\oplus$$ $$yr^{-1}$$.
This rate is typical for low/intermediate-mass protoplanetary disks and/or disks with low metallicities.
With pebble accretion, envelope enrichment and high opacity favor the formation of mini-Neptunes,
with more efficient formation at large semimajor axes ($$\gt 30$$ au) and low disk viscosities. For planetesimal
accretion, such planets can also form without enrichment, with the opacity being a key aspect in the
growth history and favorable formation location. Finally, we show that the formation of Neptune-like
planets remains a challenge for planet formation theories.
