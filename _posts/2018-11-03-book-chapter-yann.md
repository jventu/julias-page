In this chapter, we review the current understanding of planet formation processes by focusing on low-mass planets, which represent the best candidates for habitability. We present the different theoretical models that have been developed during the recent years and their predictions in terms of planetary composition, in particular their water content. We finally link the planetary composition with potential habitability.
