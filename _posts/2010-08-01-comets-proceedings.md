Comet-like orbits with low perihelion distances tend to be affected by relativisticeffects. In this work we discuss the origin of the relativistic corrections, how they affect the orbitalevolution and how to implement these corrections in a numerical integrator. We also propose amodel that mimics the principal relativistic effects and, contrary to the original “exact” formula,has low computational cost. Our model is appropriated for numerical simulations but not forprecise ephemeris computations
